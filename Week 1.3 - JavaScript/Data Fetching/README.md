# Data Fetching

For this exercise you'll need to fetch data from an API and print to the screen. We'll be using the [Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.vercel.app/) for this assessment.

Get all the films from the API and then populate the `.movies` list with the titles. Titles must be wrapped in a `<li>` tag to maintain proper HTML structure.

Add your code to the provided HTML file.
